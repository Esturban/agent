## RAG Agent

> A repo dedicated to building different Retrieval Augmented Generative Agents using LangGraph and LangChain.

This is a separate workspace exploring different agents using LangGraph and different database options to explore how to make RAG agents under different circumstances with different criteria.

The following are the contents of this repository:  

- [`examples/1-basic`](./examples/1-basic/) - A very basic RAG agent using LangGraph and LangChain.
- [`examples/2-external-vdb`](./examples/2-external-vdb/) - A RAG agent with internet search using a cloud-hosted Vector DB.
